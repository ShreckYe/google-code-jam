# Google Code Jam code
Some of my Google Code Jam practice and competition code, written in such languages in the order of my preference:

1. Kotlin
1. Scala
1. Haskell
1. Possibly others

Each question's code takes up a directory of the path "\<year\>/\<round\>/\<question-name-or-number\>[/\<language\>]" or "/\<language\>/\<year\>/\<round\>/\<question-name-or-number\>".

Each year's competition code is merged from another competition repository after it's finished, on which there might be further improvements in this repository.
